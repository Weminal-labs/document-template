# Installation

**Nextra Perosnal Website Template** is a custom theme that includes almost everything you need to build a modern **documentation** and **blog** website. It includes a top navigation bar, a search bar, a pages sidebar, a TOC sidebar, and other built-in components.

## Quick Start from Template

### Deploy to Vercel

You can start by creating your own Nextra site and deploying to Vercel by clicking the link:

<a
  className="mt-3 inline-flex"
  target="_blank"
  href="https://vercel.com/new/clone?s=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnamnguyenthanhwork%2Fnextra-personal-website-template&showOptionalTeamCreation=false"
>
  ![](https://vercel.com/button)
</a>

Vercel will fork the [Nextra Perosnal Website Template](https://github.com/namnguyenthanhwork/nextra-personal-website-template) and deploy the site for you. Once done, every commit in the repository will be deployed automatically.

### Fork the Template

You can also manually fork the [template repository](https://github.com/namnguyenthanhwork/nextra-personal-website-template).

## Start as New Project

<Steps>
### Install

To create a Nextra Perosnal Template site manually, you have to install **Next.js**, **React**, **Nextra V3 alpha**, and **Nextra Docs Theme V3 alpha**. In your project directory, run the following command to install the dependencies:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i next react react-dom nextra@alpha nextra-theme-docs@alpha
```

<Callout>
  If you already have Next.js installed in your project, you only need to install `nextra` and `nextra-theme-docs` as
  the add-ons.
</Callout>

Add the following scripts in `package.json`:

```json filename="package.json"
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start"
},
```

You can either start the server with, for example if you use npm, `npm run dev`, which will run in development mode or `npm run build && npm run start` for production mode.

<Callout>
  If you're not familiar with Next.js, note that development mode is significantly slower since Next.js compiles every
  page you navigate to.
</Callout>

### Add Next.js Config

Create the following `next.config.js` file in your projectâ€™s root directory:

```js filename="next.config.js"
const withNextra = require('nextra')({
  theme: 'nextra-theme-docs',
  themeConfig: './theme.config.jsx',
});

module.exports = withNextra();

// If you have other Next.js configurations, you can pass them as the parameter:
// module.exports = withNextra({ /* other next.js config */ })
```

With the above configuration, Nextra can handle Markdown files in your Next.js project, with the specified theme. Other Nextra configurations can be found in [Guide](https://nextra.site/docs/guide).

### Create Docs Theme Config

Lastly, create the corresponding `theme.config.jsx` file in your projectâ€™s root directory. This will be used to configure the Nextra Docs theme:

```jsx filename="theme.config.jsx"
export default {
  logo: <span>My Nextra Website Template</span>,
  project: {
    link: 'https://github.com/namnguyenthanhwork/nextra-personal-website-template',
  },
  // ... other theme options
};
```

Full theme configurations can be found [here](/en/docs/doc-theme/theme-configuration).

### Ready to Go!

Now, you can create your first MDX page as `pages/index.mdx`:

```mdx filename="pages/index.mdx"
# Welcome to Nextra

Hello, world!
```

And run the `next` or `next dev` command specified in `package.json`to start developing the project! ðŸŽ‰
