## 3. Getting Started With Weminal Document Template

A ready-made template for a documentation site is available on [Weminal’s template repository](https://github.com/Weminal-labs/document-template). So you have to create the repository from this template.

Now, in [Weminal’s template repository](https://github.com/Weminal-labs/document-template), click button `Use this template`:

You can clone this repository into your local machine by 

```jsx
git clone your_repo
```

Once you've cloned the git repository on your machine, you should have a folder structure like this:

Now that you've cloned the repository navigate into the project directory and install the dependencies:

```jsx
npm install
```

When the installation is complete, start the local development server by running the following:

```jsx
npm run dev
```
